# Anomaly Detection with the Cloud-based UEBA Log Data Set
This repository contains scripts to carry out anomaly detection in the CLUE log data set.

The publicly available CLUE-LDS (CLoud-based User Entity behavior analytics Log Data Set) contains system log events generated by real users of a customized [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) instance operated by [Huemer Group](https://www.huemer-group.com/hbox/). The data set spans over five years and contains events generated by more than 5000 anonymized users. Anonymization is carried out without loss of information, i.e., identical user and file names are replaced consistently with the same pseudonym. There exist 49 event types, such as events that report users logging into the system, editing files, sharing documents, changing configurations, etc. Some events also come with geolocations of users. For more information on the data set we refer to our publication at the bottom of this page.

As the CLUE-LDS only contains normal user and entity behavior, it is necessary to manually inject attacks. We simulate account hijacking by switching pairs of user identifiers (uid) at specific points in time. First, check out this repository and then place the unarchived CLUE-LDS in the same directory:

```bash
user@ubuntu:~$ git clone https://github.com/ait-aecid/clue-lds.git
user@ubuntu:~$ cd clue-lds/
user@ubuntu:~/clue-lds$ cp ~/Downloads/clue.json .
```
